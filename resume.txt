APPLICATION ENGINEER

I worked on the frontend portal for our self-service environment.  Originally
developed as a collection of React components, I introduced many libraries to
architect and test the application. Some of them include redux,
react-final-form, ramda, normalizr, reselect, re-reselect, mocha, chai, sinon,
postcss, etc.

* Utilize Redux to manage global application state, write custom middlewares
  accomplish side effects such as API calls and saving data to local storage,
  author selectors using reselect and re-reselect

* Lint the codebase using eslint and the airbnb rules

* Author tests based on mocha, chai, sinon, enzyme

* Introduce react-final-form to manage the form state

* Use react-final-form to manage the form state

* Add PostCSS and integrate it with webpack to build our CSS resources which
  included Bootstrap, Font Awesome and others

* Minify images using webpack and the imagemin plugin

DEVOPS ENGINEER

I was originally assigned to the Server Platform Team upon joining the company.
I helped maintain our many storage solutions (Pure Storage, Nimble Storage,
etc), our OpenStack environment, our SDN environment, and others.  Some of the
tasks I accomplished include:

* Create a dashboard which visualizes storage telemetry such as operation rates
  and latency. This was built using Fluentd, InfluxDB, Grafana, SNMP, Paramiko
  and custom Python-based tools.

* Author Python scripts for automation of routine operations of our SDN
  environment. These scripts simplified and increased the reliability of routine
  operations such as backups and resource allocation with the hosting VMware
  cluster. Made use of pyVmomi to manage VMware resources.

* Fix a problem in our OpenStack environment where sysctl variables would be
  reset upon restart. Update the Ansible playbooks and provisioned the fixes to
  all the relevant nodes.

* Migrate OpenStack instances from one of our tenants to newly added tenants.
  This involved researching and testing the procedure which included manual
  updates of the relevant MySQL records, writing a manual and executing the
  operation successfully.

Open Source Contributions
================================================================================
I have made several contributions to open source communities, mostly centered
around JavaScript and Node.js, which can be found publically in my GitHub
account.

PULL REQUESTS

* https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/pull/2745
Socket.IO is a popular websocket library for Node.js which provides abstractions
for different kinds of persistent connections, such as web sockets and XHR
polling, and additional features such as multiplexing.  This PR fixed a bug
introduced in version 1.5.0 of the library, where some query string parameters
were being ignored. The solution was to use the ES5 Object.assign function. A
polyfill to the function was added in order to keep backwards compatibility with
old IE browsers which were still being supported at the time.

* https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/pull/444
This PR fixes a bug introduced in version 1.5.1 of the library.
While the fix itself was a simple one line removal, I introduced a
regression test to ensure that the bug does not resurface in the future.

* https://github.com/agentk/fontfacegen/pull/26
fontfacegen is a library that uses FontForge in the background to generate all
the font formats required to use custom fonts on the browser. This PR introduces
a new feature to be able to select only a subset of the characters from the font
files to be output. This is especially important in font sets for Japanese,
where the whole font file size could be multiple MB, but in reality only a
handful of characters are needed, reducing the size significantly.

* https://github.com/libxmljs/libxmljs/pull/521
Adds support for XML processing instructions to the libxmljs library.  One use
case is for adding a stylesheet to svg files.  libxmljs is a wrapper around the
C library libxml2, and therefore this PR is mostly C++ code which binds the
Node.JS JavaScript engine, V8, to the relevant libxml2 functions. Implementing
this PR was very instructive in regards to the inner workings of Node.JS.

* https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form/pull/266
Very useful library to manage form state, based on the observer pattern.  This
PR introduces an example demonstrating how to integrate lookahead components
with react-final-form and redux, and demonstrates the usage of different
features of the library.

* https://github.com/jasonpincin/stream-to-string/pull/1
This small module converts a node stream into a string.  Adds the option to
specify a specific encoding when converting a stream to a string, making it a
non-breaking change and adding a regression test.  This PR is later used in my
own vinyl-to-string NPM module.

* https://github.com/izolate/html2pug/pull/2
Converts HTML into Pug, an alternative and less verbose templating language,
popular to render HTML in Express applications. The main purpose of this PR is
to replace the jsdom as the HTML parser with the standard parse5 HTML parser,
allowing to handle features of HTML such as comments, parse fragments, etc.

* https://github.com/itgalaxy/favicons/pull/110
Small NPM module used to generate favicons for different platforms and their
associated files. This PR introduced the option to add the generated HTML needed
to embed to a webpage to use the generated favicons, to the files piped in the
gulp plugin version of the module. This enables additional modifications to the
HTML, such as converting it to Pug using gulp-html2pug.

* https://github.com/JRJurman/rollup-plugin-polyfill/pull/2
Small plugin used to introduce imports (usually polyfills) to the top of an
application built by Rollup. This PR enables the generation of Source Maps,
silencing various warnings issued by Rollup during the building process, and
also adds the ability to add the imports in either CommonJS or ESM formats.

NPM MODULES

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next-conv
Due to my many contributions to i18next, I am a member of the official github
i18next organization and became the main maintainer of this module.  This module
parses and converts PO files into the i18next format which is based on JSON.
This is useful for teams where the translators use the gettext industry standard
and an integration with i18next is needed.
It has over 5000 weekly downloads.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next-fetch-backend
One of my contributions to the extensive and popular JavaScript i18n
environment, i18next, this library provides an alternative backend using fetch,
to the default XHR backend, which is useful in environments where i18next is
used both in the server and in the browser.
Currently it has over 2000 monthly downloads.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stay-scrolled
Currently having 34 stars in github and over 1000 monthly downloads, this React
library helps containers such as chat windows scroll down automatically whenever
new messages arrive.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/vinyl-contents-tostring
Module used to convert the content of vinyl files (which are the backbone of
gulp) into strings. This is used in many of my gulp plugins.
This module has over 1000 monthly downloads.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-i18next-conv
Rollup plugin integrating i18next-conv. Enables import of PO files, converting
them into JSON resources, which can then be handed to i18next. This is useful
especially when building a webview application, where all the content has to be
bundled into the app to be used offline.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-xml-transformer
Gulp integration for libxmljs.
This module has over 1000 monthly downloads.
